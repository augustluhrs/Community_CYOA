# Community_CYOA

Discord bot for a community-generated Choose-Your-Own-Adventure story where whenever a reader gets to a dead-end node, they have to write that section of the story.

Made with lots of help from Dan Shiffman's Discord Bot Tutorials!
Based on [this one](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Discord-Bot-Choo-Choo) in particular.
